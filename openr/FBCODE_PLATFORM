# See https://fburl.com/PLATFORM-files for details about platform files.
# OpenR uses the below mentioned platform as we run binaries built with buck
# on network devices (switches and routers). They as of now don't support
# gcc-5 because of older kernels. Once network devices are upgraded to newer
# kernel with gcc-5 support we will move to gcc-5
# NOTE: It can take several months to achieve that.
